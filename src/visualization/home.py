    "Hello - my name is Finbar Rhodes and I have a passion for the energy transition and am particularly " \
    "interested in flexibility and grid-scale energy storage. This role, particularly in the UK, has" \
    "increasingly been filled by battery energy storage systems (BESS). The combination of improving battery" \
    "technology, cheaper components, and the growing need for flexiblity assets in a grid increasingly " \
    "reliant on renewable energy sources leaves BESS with a bright future in the energy transition. \n\n " \
    "This is a personal coding project I have undertaken to dive into the clean tech and grid-scale" \
    "battery landscape in the UK in hopes to not just learn through doing but to result in some useful " \
    "insights. I have tried to focus on how BESS sites make their mark in the changing energy grid: " \
    "availablity for frequency response services and arbitrage activity. I have a *Market Overview* "
    "capacity section that shows how different market conditions have evolved over time as well as a "
    "*Revenue Backtesting* tool to explore a BESS sites performance (revenue generation, cycling) "
    "using naive, perfect foresight, and machine learning-based dispatch strategies. The data powering "
    "this tool is sourced from the **Elexon Insights Solution API** and **NESO Data Portal**."\

# About — BESS revenue routes & market context
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

st.markdown(
    """
    Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) do not rely on a single revenue source — they
    **stack** income from multiple markets, often simultaneously:

    | Revenue route | How it works |
    |---|---|
    | **Frequency response** (Dynamic Services) | Paid a £/MW/h availability fee to hold discharge or charge headroom; activated automatically when grid frequency deviates from 50 Hz |
    | **Wholesale arbitrage** | Charge during low-price periods (high wind, low demand); discharge during high-price periods |
    | **Balancing Mechanism (BM)** | Dispatched by NESO in real time as a BM unit to correct short-term supply/demand imbalance |
    | **Capacity Market** | Annual availability payment for committing to providing energy capacity during periods of system stress |

    **Why this tool focuses on Dynamic Services and wholesale prices:**
    Dynamic services (DC, DM, DR) dominated the GB BESS revenue stack from roughly 2021 through
    early 2023 — at times accounting for over 70% of total asset revenue, with some assets
    earning ~£156k/MW/year at the 2022 peak
    ([Modo Energy](https://modoenergy.com/research/future-of-battery-energy-storage-buildout-in-great-britain);
    [Timera Energy](https://timera-energy.com/blog/battery-investors-confront-revenue-shift-in-2023/)).
    From late 2022, a rapid influx of new BESS capacity saturated the frequency response
    markets and revenues compressed sharply — a trend visible in the clearing price charts in
    the Market Overview. Dynamic services remain a core stack component, but arbitrage and
    Capacity Market income have grown in relative importance since.

    **BESS is not the only participant in these markets.** Pumped-storage hydro (e.g. Dinorwig,
    Cruachan) has provided fast frequency response for decades. Demand-side response and some
    gas peakers also qualify, particularly for the slower DR service. However, BESS's
    sub-second response capability has made it the dominant and marginal price-setting
    technology in DC and DM auctions.

    """
    | Year | Event |
    |------|-------|
    | **2020** | NESO launches Dynamic Containment (DC) — BESS becomes the dominant provider within months, displacing gas peakers |
    | **2021** | Dynamic Regulation (DR) and Dynamic Moderation (DM) introduced; revenue stacking across all three services becomes standard |
    | **2022** | Revenue peak — DC High averaging £15–20/MW/h; leading assets earning ~£156k/MW/year |
    | **Late 2022** | Rapid capacity influx saturates frequency response markets; clearing prices begin a sharp, sustained decline |
    | **2023** | Revenue compression accelerates; wholesale arbitrage and Capacity Market grow significantly in relative importance |
    | **2024–25** | Stack diversification — operators blend FR, arbitrage, and BM participation; long-duration projects begin to emerge |
