## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git

### Installation

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:
```bash
cd gb-bess-market-analysis
```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Set up API credentials**:
   - Register for Elexon BMRS API: https://www.elexonportal.co.uk/
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
   - Add your API key to `.env`:
```
ELEXON_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

5. **Configure the project**:
   - Edit `config.yaml` to adjust date ranges, markets, and analysis parameters

## 🔧 Usage

### 1. Data Collection

Collect historical market data:

```bash
# Collect data from both sources for a date range
python src/data_collection/collect_data.py --start 2024-01-01 --end 2024-01-31

# Collect only from National Grid ESO
python src/data_collection/collect_data.py --start 2024-01-01 --end 2024-01-31 --sources neso

# Collect only from Elexon BMRS
python src/data_collection/collect_data.py --start 2024-01-01 --end 2024-01-31 --sources elexon

# Use date range from config.yaml
python src/data_collection/collect_data.py
```

**Note**: The collectors are set up with proper structure but will need the actual API endpoints verified from the data portals, as these can change. Check:
- National Grid ESO: https://data.nationalgrideso.com/
- Elexon BMRS: https://www.elexonportal.co.uk/

### 2. Run Analysis

Analyze market trends (coming soon):
```bash
python src/analysis/market_analysis.py
```

### 3. Generate Forecasts

Train and evaluate forecasting models (coming soon):
```bash
python src/forecasting/train_models.py
```

### 4. Launch Dashboard

Start the interactive Streamlit dashboard (coming soon):
```bash
streamlit run src/visualization/dashboard.py
```

## 📊 Key Markets Analyzed

- **Dynamic Containment (DC)**: Fast-acting frequency response
- **Dynamic Regulation (DR)**: Continuous frequency regulation
- **Dynamic Moderation (DM)**: Slower frequency response
- **Balancing Mechanism (BM)**: Energy balancing market
- **Frequency Response (FR)**: Traditional frequency services
- **Day-Ahead Market**: Energy arbitrage opportunities

## 🔮 Forecasting Models

The project will implement and compare multiple forecasting approaches:

1. **Statistical Models**:
   - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
   - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
   - Prophet (Facebook's time series forecasting)

2. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting
   - Feature engineering with lag and rolling statistics

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - RMSE, MAE, MAPE metrics
   - Cross-validation
   - Residual analysis

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### API Endpoints
The data collectors are structured with proper error handling and rate limiting, but you'll need to:
1. Verify the actual API endpoints from the official documentation
2. Check the response structure and adjust parsing accordingly
3. Some endpoints may require authentication beyond just an API key

### Data Availability
- Dynamic Containment data is typically available from 2020 onwards
- Some historical data may have different formats
- Check data availability windows for each market

### Rate Limits
- National Grid ESO: Currently set to 100 requests/minute
- Elexon BMRS: Currently set to 60 requests/minute
- Adjust in config.yaml if needed
